A work in progress box2d module for monkey2 initiated by nitrologic "github.com/nitrologic/m2" but has disappeared from the repo.. (31/08/2016)

Complete:

* Native C++ box2d source building from mx2cc
* Basic b2World and b2Vec2 class tests
* Machine generated (badly) API definition 
* Example 1:"HelloBox2D_text" demo with a dynamic circle bouncing on a static one (no gfx)
* Example 2:"HelloBox2D_mojo" demo with two dynamic circles bouncing on a static polygon (With Gfx!)
* Example 4:"HelloBox2D_mojo_rube" demo that import some c++ assets generated by the R.U.B.E. editor
* mojo2 based simulation debugger 
* Example 5:All Bodies and Joints type created from Monkey 2 in the "bodies and joints.monkey2" demo
* Example 6:Basic Importing Json RUBE (with asset construct => compatible with android)

WIP:

* Json import (images, joints and bodies and fixture names/ids, ....)
* API definition (callback, generics,...see box2d.monkey2)

Todo:

* Minmal feature set for more basic demos 
* full API definition (manual?/wict machine?) -> Almost done (still generics and other small things)
* Callback demo sample
* Larger demo with use of joints, buoyancy, external forces,...
* request for volunteers

Please submit pull requests if you do things!
